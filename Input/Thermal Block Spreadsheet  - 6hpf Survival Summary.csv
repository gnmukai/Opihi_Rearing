11,1A,2,A,3,5,0,0,Jan.6,"GM; fertilization began at 9, populated thermal block at 10:35, started looking at 5-6hpf. In treatment for 4 -5 more or less; good; T6 larvae had cilia that were obvious without much camera adjustments and were quite mobile in some cases"
9,1A,2,A,3,5,2,0.4,Jan.6,GM; 2 are ciliated (1 of the 2 is a barely a flicker but I saw a flicker of movement)
6,1A,2,A,3,5,3,0.6,Jan.6,GM; 3 are ciliated as far as I can tell
11,1A,2,A,2,5,0,0,Jan.6,GM
9,1A,2,A,2,5,4,0.8,Jan.6,GM; 4 of 5 have ciliated and moving

11,2,3,A,3,5,0,0,Feb.10,"GM; fertilization at 9-9:30, populated thermal block at 11, 4-4.5 hours in treatment; T6 larvae had small moving cilia but weren't moving themselves "
10,2,3,A,3,5,0,0,Feb.10,GM
9,2,3,A,3,5,4,0.8,Feb.10,at least 4 (maybe 5); GM going to stick with 4
6,2,3,A,3,5,3,0.6,Feb.10,GM; 3 at 24hpf; def 1 without cilia; so either 3 or 4; going with 3 based off the videos 
1,2,3,A,3,5,5,1,Feb.10,at least 4 but all 5 were dividing at 6 hpf (4 survived to 24hpf); GM going to stick with 5
11,2,3,A,2,5,0,0,Feb.10,GMl doesn't look like any ciliated
10,2,3,A,2,5,0,0,Feb.10,GM; none had cilia
9,2,3,A,2,5,3,0.6,Feb.10,3 had cilia; only 2 survived to 24 hpf; GM
6,2,3,A,2,5,5,1,Feb.10,5 had cilia; GM
1,2,3,A,2,5,4,0.8,Feb.10,"at least 4; 4 def dividing, one ambiguous at 6 hpf (4 survived to 24 hpf); GM going to stick with 4"
